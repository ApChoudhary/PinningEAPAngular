# WebApp
  
 ### Pre-requisite:
  Make sure the [Flask-api-starter](https://github.com/pwankhade/flask-api-starter) is setup and running on the system. The angular starter application UI uses the API integration to these endpoints

### Setup
  Below are the steps for the starter code setup:
 1. Clone the repository to the local folder and open the folder in the VSCode editor.
 2. Open command prompt in the same directory and run ```ng serve```
 3. Once the command completes open the below URL in browser
 ```http://localhost:4200/```
 4. This should open up the login page. Enter the username as "bob" and password as "asdf".
 5. This should navigate to the landing page and display "Hello World!"
